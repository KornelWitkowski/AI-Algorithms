# AI Algorithms

 The project contains applications of several artificial intelligence algorithms excluding neural networks.

## Breadth first search: Spider bot

The script based on the breadth-first-search algorithm seeks urls in the internet starting from the html of the given intial urls, then it checks htmls of visited website and adds found url to its queue.

## Depth first search: Maze solver 

A maze solver based on the depth-first-search algorithm. It finds a path or check if there is no solution. However, in the implementation a path won't be always the shortest.

## Genetic algorithm: Knigths

Algorithm looks for a configuration of given number knigths in which the pieces on a chessboard do not attack themselves.

## Simulated Annealing: Architect

In the architect game, the player is supposed to put containers for every house on the board in such a way that containers do not border (also diagonally). The number indicates how many containers should be in a row or in a column. The computer solves the problem with the simulated annealing algorithm.

## Particle Swarm Optimization: fiding global minimum of a function

The particle swarm optimization was used to find the global minimum of a selected function. The algorithm creates a given number of particles that explore the search space of a problem, and the particles exchange information about found values. As a result of the information exchange, the global minimum is found.

## Q-learning: Tic Tac Toe:

Q-learning algorithm was used to train a neural network to play a tic tac toe game. However, it is only a proof of concept, and further optimizations can be made.
