# AI Algorithms

 The project contains applications of several artificial intelligence algorithms excluding neural networks.

## Breadth first search: Spider bot

The script based on the breadth-first-search algorithm seeks urls in the internet starting from the html of the given intial urls, then it checks htmls of visited website and adds found url to its queue.

## Depth first search: Maze solver 

A maze solver based on the depth-first-search algorithm. It finds a path or check if there is no solution. However, in the implementation a path won't be always the shortest.

## Genetic algorithm: Knigths - 

Algorithm looks for a configuration of given number knigths in which the pieces on a chessboard do not attack themselves.

## Simulated Annealing: Architect

In the architect game, player is supposed to put containers for every house in the board in such way that containers do not border (also diagonaly). The number indicate how many containers should be in a row or in a column. Computer solves the problem with the simulated annealing algorithm.
