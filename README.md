# Algorithms

 The project contains applications of several artificial intelligence algorithms excluding neural networks.

## Spider bot - breadth first search

The script based on the breadth-first-search algorithm seeks urls in the internet starting from the html of the given intial urls, then it checks htmls of visited website and adds found url to its queue.

## Maze solver - depth first search

A maze solver based on the depth-first-search algorithm. It finds a path or check if there is no solution. However, in the implementation a path won't be always the shortest.
